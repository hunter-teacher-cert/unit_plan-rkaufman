let's make a Bike class

- private isntance variables

- constructor -- how do we know how to name the constructor?

- this.model = model (this keyword)

- add a bikeInfo method

- overloaded constructors -- more than two ways to create a Bike!

- make threes bikes then print them out!

WHAT IF WE WANT TO SAY WHICH BIKE HAS MORE SPEED?

we need a way to get the speed stored on each Bike object...

we COULD make instance variables public... (show this)

BUT WE DON'T - data encapsulation!

we use GETTER methods!  methods that return the instance variable's value

add getter methods

what if we made a type and want to change a Bike's model?

if they were public we could set, but again we don't do this

SETTER METHOD!  void method used to set

show results of setting
